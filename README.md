# CardioPredict – Heart Disease Risk Prediction

**CardioPredict** is an advanced machine learning project that integrates a complete ML pipeline into an interactive web application. The goal is to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases using clinical data, while offering transparency through visual explanations.

---

## Overview

This project includes:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** implementing a full ML pipeline from preprocessing to SHAP-based model interpretation.
- A **Streamlit-based web app** for interactive heart disease prediction and analysis.

## ML Pipeline (Jupyter Notebook)

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values, outliers
- RobustScaler for numerical features
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
- Pipelines built using `scikit-learn`

### Model Training
- Classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest
- Ensemble: Voting & Stacking
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Cross-validation applied

### Model Explainability
- Global insights: SHAP Summary, Beeswarm, and Dependence Plots
- Local insights: Force Plot, Waterfall, and Decision Plots

## Web Application (Streamlit)

### Single Prediction
Input patient health parameters and receive a binary prediction (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk), along with **SHAP visualizations**.

### Batch Prediction
(CSV & Excel) Upload a CSV or Excel file containing patient data. The app processes the file, applies transformations, and returns the prediction results (available for download in both CSV and Excel formats). 
### Interactive Visualizations
Use dynamic plots (histograms, boxplots, pie charts, radar charts) to compare user inputs with population data.

### Model Interpretability
Built-in SHAP Explainer provides feature importance and local/global explanations using:
- Summary Plots
- Dependence Plots
- Waterfall Plots
